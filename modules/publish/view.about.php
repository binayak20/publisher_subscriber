Here we establish a network where some information such as text, image, link etc. are published by a publisher from a category or sub-category and this information will reach every child and subscriber of that category or sub-category. This communication system is designed higher to lower hierarchy (a system or organization in which category and sub-category are ranked one above the other according to authority) from root to leaf of the tree. This system is our publisher-subscriber network system.
